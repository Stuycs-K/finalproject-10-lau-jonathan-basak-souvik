Imported gif animation library and tested loading gifs and image arrays.

### 2025-05-26: Stegosaurus
Wrote an algorithm for hiding an image within another to be revealed by stegsolve. It converts the secret image into black-and-white and hides it in the specified bit plane of the original image. I also made it work with GIFs, however due to how GIFs handle colors, it's only really effective when using a bit plane of 5 or higher, so possibly won't include it.
